# Looking Forward
Take more classes at the Clay Studio → Since I’ll be staying in Philly this summer to work on my research, I think it would be great to balance lab work with pottery classes at the Clay Studio. I used to do pottery and developed a renewed appreciation for it after the workshop earlier this semester. It feels like the perfect way to relax and create something with my hands.

Go back to the Common Press → Discovering that our campus has a resource like the Common Press, free to use, was one of my favorite parts of the semester. I plan to go back and get certified for independent use so I can print art for my apartment, personalized letterhead, or cards for friends and family.

Work more on HTML → I’d love to create my own website to showcase both my hobbies and research. For example, I’m an avid knitter and crafter, so it would be fun to share my projects. I also work in a research lab and am starting an independent research project, which would be cool to showcase on a personal site.
