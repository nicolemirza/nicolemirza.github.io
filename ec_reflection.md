# Reflecting on time spent in the EC, and shared humanity.

The goal of our project in the EC was to humanize the lives of prisoners by demonstrating how, just like everyone else, they cared about and celebrated holidays. This idea stemmed from our visit to Eastern State Penitentiary, where we learned that prisoners decorated for Christmas and found ways to partake in festivities, despite their circumstances. This moment stuck with us, and we felt compelled to bring that same humanizing lens to our project. Using data from The Umpire, we honed in on the year 1916 because it was the earliest year with the most holidays represented, and used this as our main dataset.

It felt important to emphasize how, even within confinement, people still yearn to celebrate. Especially since this project coincided with the holiday season, the parallels were on our minds. For many, the holidays serve as a form of escape, whether from our busy schedules or everyday responsibilities. The prisoners’ stories of celebrating holidays echoed this universal need, and our project became about bringing light to the parallels between their experiences and ours.
 
Although my initial role was as the design facilitator, I think I ended up sharing this role with Hannah, the fabricator, as we worked very closely together. The design and fabrication processes were deeply collaborative, often blurring the lines between our assigned roles. Together, we brainstormed, sketched, and refined the concept into something we were both proud of.

Our final design, a 12-tiered tree, with each layer representing a month in 1916, emerged as a vertical timeline. Each tier displayed the number of times a holiday was mentioned in the dataset, using stickers as symbols. The stickers served both a functional and decorative role, representing the significance and anticipation surrounding these holidays for prisoners at the time. Our tree became a tangible and visual narrative that proves the resilience of holiday traditions, even behind bars.

As the design facilitator, one of my personal goals was to ensure that the project was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I drew inspiration from the intricate designs of holiday ornaments, such as stars and snowflakes, and incorporated these elements into our tree. While the finished piece successfully communicates a story and conveys the data, it also has a decorative, inviting presence. Even while I was simply carrying it from my apartment to our class, people stopped me along the way to ask about it, with strangers even commenting on how much they liked it! I’m proud that we achieved this balance and created something both meaningful and beautiful.

Of course, no creative process is without its hurdles, and our project was no exception. We faced constraints of time and materials that forced us to adapt quickly. Initially, we planned to engrave intricate designs directly onto the wooden tiers using the laser cutter. However, we soon realized this process was too time-consuming to complete within our timeline. After some discussion, we pivoted and decided to use stickers instead, which allowed us to meet the deadline without sacrificing the clarity of our data visualization. Even with this adjustment, Hannah and I stayed behind after class for an extra hour and a half to complete the fabrication. The EC staff’s willingness to help us during this extended time was a kindness we deeply appreciated.

Reflecting on this, I think the simplification made sense for the circumstances, but if we’d had more time, I would have loved to incorporate laser-cut ornaments that hung from the tree or engraved designs directly onto the wood. Also, adding a key or legend for the stickers could have made the project even more intuitive for viewers. In hindsight, these additions might have polished the piece further, but I still feel that we made the best of what we had.

Overall, our group worked well together, and the division of tasks felt natural and effective. I truly believe that each member leaned into their strengths, and everyone carried out their responsibilities with care and dedication. Despite our busy schedules, we found time to collaborate meaningfully. I’d like to highlight Sukya’s contribution–she developed code that streamlined our ability to analyze the dataset and detect the frequency of holiday mentions. This was incredibly helpful in the early stages of the project and allowed us to focus more on the creative aspects.

Hannah deserves special acknowledgment as well. Her hard work and shared enthusiasm for the design process made every challenge feel manageable. Whether we were designing in Adobe Illustrator or gluing the final pieces together, there was a true sense of partnership. In the attached pictures, you’ll see both of us fully immersed in the fabrication process.

To me, this project was not only about telling a story from the past, but also connecting that story to our present lives. Particularly, I see this through recognizing that celebrating the holidays is a shared experience, even in unlikely places. I think our tree succeeds in inviting viewers to step into the world of 1916 prisoners, to imagine their holiday celebrations, and to reflect on the resilience of the human spirit.

At the same time, working on this project, in many ways, became a reflection of our own adaptability as a group. We learned to pivot when necessary, to compromise without losing sight of our vision, and to trust each other’s insights and input. Moving forward, I want to carry this lesson with me: that creative projects are often a balance between ambition and practicality as well as between the original vision and what’s ultimately possible. For now, though, I’m proud of what we’ve created. Although it is a very simple piece, I hope that it can still be thought provoking in some way for the viewer. A small tree with a big story, if you will.
